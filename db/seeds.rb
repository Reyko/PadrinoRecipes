#             biography: "Scottish by birth, Gordon Ramsay was brought up in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.  With an injury prematurely putting an end to any hopes of a promising career in football, he went back to college to complete a course in hotel management.  His dedication and natural talent led him to train with some of the world’s leading chefs, such as Albert Roux and Marco Pierre White in London, and Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon in France." )



# "In a glass bowl, combine tomatoes, garlic, beef stock, thyme, and salt and pepper; mix well.In a large saucepan over medium heat, saute the mushrooms in the butter for 3 or 4 minutes.Add the tomato mixture, the Tabasco sauce and the gin and heat just until liquid begins to boil.Add cream and heat until liquid is just near the boiling point, but do not let it boil.Serve immediately."



"Boil skinless chicken breasts until cooked. One breast per person.
Remove cooked breasts from water. Do not throw away the water - we will use it to cook the rice. Cut the breasts into small pieces eg one inch cubes.
Cook white rice as you would normally, using the stock from the boiled chicken instead of water. (If there’s not enough stock, top it up with water).
Fry chopped garlic and chopped red peppers in butter until soft. Remove from frying pan.
Pour a large pot of double cream into the frying pan and heat slowly. When it starts to bubble, simmer until the quantity has been reduced to about half the original volume.
Put the fried garlic, red peppers and cooked chicken pieces into the reduced cream. Add salt and pepper and a dash of sherry. Cook for a few minutes to let the flavours settle into each other.
When the rice is cooked, stir into it a knob of butter.
Serve the rice with the chicken. Singing \"Rule Britannia\" before tucking in is not obligatory."
